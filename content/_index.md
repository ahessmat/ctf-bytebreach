Welcome, weary traveler.
Come and take a seat.
Add some logs to the fire.
Look around.
Do you hear it?
I wish I could make this.
This website is so cool.
The guns don't work, but they look cool.
What door?
There's nothing left anymore.
They are all gone now.
There's a horse in aisle 5.
This place,
The isolation,
I can't take it anymore.
Add text here!
Thank you for coming.
I'm sure they will see you soon.
If not, I offer great company.
Who is actually going to sit through all these? -\_-
help me
Some party, huh?
DO NOT ACTIVATE LIGHT MODE!
What is "real"?
The things we see?
The things we feel?
The things we think?
_random quotes here_
I wish this could never end.
MY EYES!
Damn, I wonder how many of these I can come up with.
I'm sure you'll find me someday.
Ok, that's all for now.
