# Prologue

These are my writeups of a few of the reverse engineering problems I tackled during this year's HacktheBox Cyber Apocalypse 2025 CTF. Unfortunately, I could only allocate a few hours in the evenings to engaging the problems and wasn't able to finish the complete set.

I found myself reaching for `GDB` and `Ghidra` for almost all of the problems vs. approaching them with more programmatic/automated solutions. Towards the end of my participation, I found one problem (`SingleStep` - did not finish) to be particularly vexxing since it was a self-modifying binary that unspooled as it executed, rendering static analysis pretty moot. I found myself thinking back on one of my college classes for malware analysis and thought it might be worthwhile to perform some concolic analysis with `angr`, but ran out of time. As an after-action, that's something I'll want to brush-up on for future challenges.

Anyhow, on with the writeup!

# Reversing

## SealedRune

There was probably an easier way to go about this than I did, but to each their own!

I started by popping the binary into Ghidra, which mapped out the binary's functions. 

> For the unfamiliar: Ghidra is freely-available suite of reverse engineering and binary analysis tools published/maintained by the NSA. Among its other features, it includes a disassembler and a decompiler (the latter offering a best guess at rebuilding the source code in C). Throughout this writeup, I've copied the decompiled source code provided by Ghidra into the post.
{: .prompt-tip }

Thankfully, there were plenty of symbols in place that let us get quickly oriented to the binary's functionality. This can be inferred by running the `file <filename>` command on the binary and observing that those symbols were `not stripped`. By having those symbols retained at compiled-time, Ghidra's decompiler is able to rebuild things like the original method names.

### main()

```c
undefined8 main(void)

{
  long in_FS_OFFSET;
  undefined local_48 [56];
  long local_10;
  
  local_10 = *(long *)(in_FS_OFFSET + 0x28);
  anti_debug();
  display_rune();
  puts(&DAT_00102750);
  printf("Enter the incantation to reveal its secret: ");
  __isoc99_scanf(&DAT_001027c5,local_48);
  check_input(local_48);
  if (local_10 != *(long *)(in_FS_OFFSET + 0x28)) {
                    /* WARNING: Subroutine does not return */
    __stack_chk_fail();
  }
  return 0;
}
```
Looking at the above, we can see:

1. The binary would start by calling `anti_debug()`, which would terminate the program if it detected it was in a debugger, like `GDB`. This is meant to stymie dynamic analysis.
2. The binary would do some graphical output before prompting the user for input, passing that input to `check_input()`.

### check_input()

```c
void check_input(char *param_1)

{
  int iVar1;
  char *__s2;
  long lVar2;
  
  __s2 = (char *)decode_secret();
  iVar1 = strcmp(param_1,__s2);
  if (iVar1 == 0) {
    puts(&DAT_00102050);
    lVar2 = decode_flag();
    printf("\x1b[1;33m%s\x1b[0m\n",lVar2 + 1);
  }
  else {
    puts("\x1b[1;31mThe rune rejects your words... Try again.\x1b[0m");
  }
  free(__s2);
  return;
}
```
3. `check_input()` would decode the stored secret, compare it to what we entered and then decode the flag if it matched with `decode_flag()`

### decode_flag()

```c
undefined8 decode_flag(void)

{
  undefined8 uVar1;
  
  uVar1 = base64_decode(flag);
  reverse_str(uVar1);
  return uVar1;
}
```
4. Decode flag would load the flag from memory, then base64-decode it and reverse the string.

There's several ways we could have gone about this, but I ended up reaching for `GDB`.

`GDB` has a lot of neat tricks to it, including being able to arbitrarily `jump` to any valid instruction we want (e.g. `jump *0x555555555462`); bear in mind, `GDB` resumes process execution after the jump, so we also want to set breakpoints (`b`) to pause and observe state. Doing this lets us trivially skip over `anti_debug()` (and - in fact - go wherever we want). With that we could jump to where `decode_secret()` is invoked in `check_input()` (and thereby learn the secret we need to pass):

VaelGnuffraz

Or we could jump into `decode_flag()` directly and grab the base64-encoded string:

LmB9ZDNsNDN2M3JfYzFnNG1fM251cntCVEhgIHNpIGxsZXBzIHRlcmNlcyBlaFQ=

Or even the decoded flag:

The secret spell is `HTB{run3_m4g1c_r3v34l3d}`.

## EncryptedScroll

Like before, we can load this binary into `Ghidra` to get a sense of how this binary behaves.

## main()
```c

undefined8 main(void)

{
  long in_FS_OFFSET;
  undefined local_48 [56];
  long local_10;
  
  local_10 = *(long *)(in_FS_OFFSET + 0x28);
  anti_debug();
  display_scroll();
  printf(&DAT_00102220);
  __isoc99_scanf(&DAT_00102268,local_48);
  decrypt_message(local_48);
  if (local_10 != *(long *)(in_FS_OFFSET + 0x28)) {
                    /* WARNING: Subroutine does not return */
    __stack_chk_fail();
  }
  return 0;
}
```
This challenge behaves similarly to the last insofar as having an `anti_debug()` method, some ASCII art, and then a call to `decrypt_message()` to invariably get a flag.

### decrypt_message()
```c

void decrypt_message(char *param_1)

{
  int iVar1;
  long in_FS_OFFSET;
  int local_3c;
  undefined8 local_38;
  undefined4 local_30;
  undefined4 uStack_2c;
  undefined4 uStack_28;
  undefined8 local_24;
  long local_10;
  
  local_10 = *(long *)(in_FS_OFFSET + 0x28);
  local_38 = 0x716e32747c435549;
  local_30 = 0x6760346d;
  uStack_2c = 0x6068356d;
  uStack_28 = 0x75327335;
  local_24 = 0x7e643275346e69;
  for (local_3c = 0; *(char *)((long)&local_38 + (long)local_3c) != '\0'; local_3c = local_3c + 1) {
    *(char *)((long)&local_38 + (long)local_3c) = *(char *)((long)&local_38 + (long)local_3c) + -1;
  }
  iVar1 = strcmp(param_1,(char *)&local_38);
  if (iVar1 == 0) {
    puts("The Dragon\'s Heart is hidden beneath the Eternal Flame in Eldoria.");
  }
  else {
    puts("The scroll remains unreadable... Try again.");
  }
  if (local_10 != *(long *)(in_FS_OFFSET + 0x28)) {
                    /* WARNING: Subroutine does not return */
    __stack_chk_fail();
  }
  return;
}
```

We can see that a number of operations are performed on some bytes, ultimately comparing user input to the flag. Ergo, the trivial solution is to `jump` to the `cmp` instruction (where the `strcmp()` call is made above), which would show us the flag that's getting compared against:

`HTB{s1mpl3_fl4g_4r1thm3t1c}`


## EndlessCycle
This binary - unlike `SealedRune` - didn't come with all the symbols necessary to neatly rebuild main and its relative components. However, we could still dump `strings` from the binary and then search for those strings getting called in the binary's assembly with `Ghidra`. In fact, if we ran the binary straightaway, we could also get a rough estimation of where our input landed within.

### FUN_00101169()

```c
undefined8 FUN_00101169(void)

{
  int iVar1;
  code *pcVar2;
  ulong local_28;
  ulong local_20;
  
  pcVar2 = (code *)mmap((void *)0x0,0x9e,7,0x21,-1,0);
  srand(DAT_001042b8);
  for (local_28 = 0; local_28 < 0x9e; local_28 = local_28 + 1) {
    for (local_20 = 0; local_20 < (ulong)(long)*(int *)(&DAT_00104040 + local_28 * 4);
        local_20 = local_20 + 1) {
      rand();
    }
    iVar1 = rand();
    pcVar2[local_28] = SUB41(iVar1,0);
  }
  iVar1 = (*pcVar2)();
  if (iVar1 == 1) {
    puts("You catch a brief glimpse of the Dragon\'s Heart - the truth has been revealed to you");
  }
  else {
    puts("The mysteries of the universe remain closed to you...");
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This is - presumably - `main()`, if not a function that gets called within `main()`.

Something that was a little interesting from the get-go is that we see the string `What is the flag?` printed directly to the console when we run the binary, but we can't find that string in our binary through Ghidra.

It turns out, the reason for this is owed to the above nested for-loop, terminating with the iVar1 assignment to `(*pcVar2)()`. In effect this is creating some shellcode to execute, which is responsible for ingesting and handling our user input.

At first, I tried dumping the contents of `rax` at the `call rax` instruction right where `(*pcVar2)()` invokes, and then disassemble them with https://defuse.ca/online-x86-assembler.htm#disassembly2. However, this proved inaccurate. Instead, it proved easier to simply use `GDB`'s step (`s`) function to step into the function call. After that, we could dump the instructions for a more accurate picture:

`x/50i $pc`

   ```
At a high-level, the assembly instructions are writing out the prompt *"What is the flag?"*, then reading in input to the buffer. It then reads in the user's input, the XORs the bytes of that input - 4 bytes at a time - against the key `0xbeefcafe`. Finally, it compares the XOR'd output against the XOR'd flag at `0x7ffff7fbf07a`; assuming the bytes match, then the shellcode returns 1 (otherwise it returns 0).

By setting a breakpoint at `0x7ffff7fbf07a`, we can dump the XOR'd bytes of the flag...

![alt text](/assets/images/2025/htbctf1.png)

```
0xc5ad9eb6      0xd5dffa92      0xc7dca8a1      0xe18ba4ce
0xe1dca28a      0xd29dfa89      0x0000b79a
```

...and XOR each set of 4 bytes again against `0xbeefcafe` (as XORing bytes twice against the same key returns the same result). Converting the re-XOR'd bytes to ASCII gives the flag:

`HTB{l00k_b3y0nd_th3_w0rld}`

## ImpossiMaze

This binary put out a seemingly random grid, with a player-controlled "X" to navigate about using the arrow keys.

![alt text](/assets/images/2025/htbctf2.png)

This was the first problem in the CTF that it wasn't immediately apparent to me where the flag was meant to be produced. I thought at the onset that we were meant to debug the functionality of the game, then play it somehow in a particular way as to revealing the flag. That didn't end up being the case.

There were a few custom functions defined, but only one that Ghidra really produced anything notable for us to review.

The above code defines the process' main game-loop. A lot about this may be pretty overwhelming (and ultimately - not of consequence to solving this), but there's something in particular our attention can be brought to:

```c
if ((uVar3 == 0xd) && (uVar4 == 0x25))
```

The above if-check looks at `uVar3` and `uVar4`, which we can see in the code reference the rows/columns of the terminal that's running the game board. If they equate to `0xd` and `0x25` (13 and 37, respectively), the game board renders a hidden message, namely:

`HTB{th3_curs3_is_brok3n}`
